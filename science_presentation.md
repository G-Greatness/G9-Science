# Science Snapshot: Forces, Energy, Matter

--- Slide 1: Why Science Matters
- Science gives us language for the energy that moves us, the matter that composes life, and the forces that keep everything in motion.
- This quick, text-only slideshow connects physics, chemistry, and biology through the everyday physics of falling objects and the energy that powers atoms and cells.

--- Slide 2: Physics – Falling and Forces
- Gravity accelerates every object toward the Earth at roughly 9.8 m/s² regardless of mass, so a feather and a rock fall differently only because of air resistance.
- The energy perspective: when something falls, its gravitational potential energy converts into kinetic energy (motion) and, eventually, heat or sound when it hits.
- Key idea: energy is conserved—what you lose in height becomes motion or other forms, which is measurable and predictable.

--- Slide 3: Physics – Energy Breakdown
- Potential energy (stored energy) depends on height and mass; kinetic energy (motion) depends on velocity.
- Energy transforms smoothly: dropping a ball shows mechanical energy turning into vibrational energy in the ground and air.
- No mysterious buttons—only mass, force, speed, and the rules of conservation.

--- Slide 4: Chemistry – Matter, Bonds, and Energy
- Chemistry explains how atoms stick together with energetic bonds; breaking or forming those bonds absorbs or releases energy.
- Consider combustion: loosely held molecules like hydrocarbons release stored chemical energy, heating the surroundings.
- Energy also governs reaction rates and equilibrium; temperature changes or catalysts tip the balance toward products or reactants.

--- Slide 5: Biology – Energy in Living Systems
- Organisms harvest chemical energy (like glucose) from food and convert it into ATP, the biological “energy currency.”
- Muscles and cells rely on the same physics of falling and motion—biological motion is powered by converting chemical energy into mechanical work.
- Plants capture light energy via photosynthesis and lock it into chemical bonds, keeping the energy flow moving from physics (light and heat) to chemistry (bonds) to biology (life).

--- Slide 6: Bringing It Together
- Energy links physics, chemistry, and biology: gravitational energy drives motion, chemical bonds store and release energy, and living systems manage that energy carefully.
- Understanding basic falling and motion helps explain everything from how rain hits the ground to why our bodies feel tired after exercise.
- Keep asking: Where does the energy go next? The answer leads through all three sciences.
